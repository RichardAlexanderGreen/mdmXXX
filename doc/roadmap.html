<h1>Roadmap</h1>
  <p> Assets come first because they provide the basis for other (more interesting) things.
      Scale tests create electrical services which connect to transformers which connect to circuits.
      Services are monitored by meters which are a kind of device.
      Devices have part numbers, suppliers, and connections to other devices.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Define specific assets as entities with arbitrary attribute dictionaries. </li>
    <li>A super-type defines a set of default attribute sets. </li>
    <li>Devices have locations (GPS coordinates).</li>
    <li>Circuits have a location-centroid defined by the average GPS of its transformers.</li>
    <li>Simulator creates multiple circuits, transformers, services with connections.</li>
    <li>Store { entity_attribute, { Entity, Attribute }, [ { TimeStamp, Value }  ]  } in persistent tables</li>
    <li>Store { entity_relation,  { Entity, Relation } , [ { TimeStamp, Entity } ]  } in persistent tables</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The demand simulator comes second.
      It simulates the meter network and publishes usage data.
      The usage history component collects usage data.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Meters report demand data in real time giving their service, transformer, and circuit. </li>
    <li>Store { service_demand, Service, Measure, TimePeriod } in persistent tables.</li>
    <li>Services, transformers, and circuits aggregate demand. </li>
    <li>Store { transformer_demand, Device, Measure, TimePeriod } in persistent tables.</li>
    <li>Store { circuit_demand,     Device, Measure, TimePeriod } in persistent tables.</li>
    <li>This version does not attempt to validate data or detect gaps in the data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The event simulator comes third.
     It simulates power outage events.
     Events are aggregated to transformers (sub-circuits) and circuits.
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Meters report outage events.</li>
     <li>Outage events are aggregated by transformer (sub-circuit) and circuit.</li>
     <li>This version does not attempt to simulate restoration events or device state.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Device state comes fourth.
      Erlang gen_FSM processes track meter and circuit state.     
   </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Model meter state as a gen_FSM pattern.</li>
    <li>Model circuit state as a gen_FSM pattern.</li>
    <li>Connect event process to FSM state models.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Refinements ranked fifth priority include:
    <br />Detect gaps in usage data.
    <br />Detect devices that are installed but appear to be inactive.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detect gaps in usage data.
      <br />-- Each circuit scans its services periodically (at least daily) to detect any gaps since the last scan.
    </li>
    <li>Detect devices that are installed but appear to be unreliable.
      <br >-- A device with an excessive quantity (minutes) of gaps may require some repair or assistance (e.g. a signal booster).
    </li>
  </ul>
